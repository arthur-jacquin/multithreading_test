Trying out multithreading
________________________________________________________________________________

editor in Zig" series.


-- <span id="001">[<a class="t" href="#001">001</a>]</span> Goals -----------------------------------------------------------------

No Zig for today! As it's new for me, I want to try multithreading using classic
tools first: C and <code>pthread.h</code>. I read <a href="https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/">this tutorial</a> to get started.

I set out to explore multithreading in successive stages, introducing new
concepts one by one. The broad end goal was a program with at least two threads
running concurrently and communicating data in a safe way.


-- <span id="002">[<a class="t" href="#002">002</a>]</span> Steps -----------------------------------------------------------------

Note: the code for each of the following steps can be downloaded <a href="multithreading_test.tar.gz">here</a> or browsed
<a href="https://github.com/arthur-jacquin/multithreading_test">here</a>.

No multithreading for the first step, the point is to design what will be run
concurrently (while remaining sequential for the moment). In this case, the
program does two things: it collects an user specified string, then it displays
a countdown to zero. I used <code><a href="https://github.com/termbox/termbox2">termbox2.h</a></code> for user input collection and visual
feedback in the terminal.

Once it's working, I turned the sequential program into a multithreaded one,
collecting user input and updating the countdown at the same time. For more
robustness, any terminal rendering with <code>termbox2.h</code> was supposed not thread-safe.
It therefore requires a mutex for serialization, as both threads issue calls to
<code>termbox2.h</code>.

Then, I added inter-thread communication with a queue: until a coutdown is being
processed, the user can enter new coutdown durations to be processed after. That
calls for another mutex for data safety, as both threads interact with the
queue.

Lastly, I introduced a condition variable so that new countdown durations can be
entered at any time. I also refactored the code to move multithreading-related
code to wrappers. Doing so limits occurences of such code, and thus ease
appropriate error handling, correctness evaluation and maintenance, even though
I skipped error handling (I wonder how it would compare in Zig).

At the moment I'm happy with where I am with the experimentations. I especially
enjoyed implementing the <code>pthread_queue.h</code> library: it has a <code>pthread.h</code>-inspired
API and works with any type of data!


-- <span id="003">[<a class="t" href="#003">003</a>]</span> Notes for later -------------------------------------------------------

* Multithreading can be appealing in various cases, but it comes with a
  complexity cost, which must be kept in mind during the design process.

* Accessing/modifying global variables should mostly be done through wrapper
  functions, to centralize thread safety and error handling code.

* Things to think about when designing a multithreaded program:
    * When threads terminate? Should they be joined?
    * How threads communicate?
    * Which statements/functions are blocking? Can deadlocks occur?
    * Which library calls are thread-safe? Which are not?
    * When using dynamically-allocated memory, which thread is responsible for
      freeing which object?

* <code>pthread_t</code> (just like other <code>pthread.h</code> types) should be considered opaque. For
  example, it means <code>pthread_equal()</code> should be used instead of <code>==</code>.

* Threads should be explicitely set at joinable.

* <code>pthread_exit()</code> is implicitely called when a thread start routine returns, but
  must be explicitely called in <code>main()</code>.

* Mutexes and condition variables can be initialized statically (if using
  default attributes) with <code>PTHREAD_{MUTEX,COND}_INITIALIZER</code>.

* Mutex locking attemps can be non-blocking with <code>pthread_mutex_trylock()</code>.

* <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code> might not wake up immediately after a
  <code>pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast}()</code> call: it still needs to lock the mutex back.
  Therefore, the signalling thread must release the associated mutex
  (if it owns it).

* <code>pthread.h</code> implementations can issue spurious wake up to waiting threads, thus
  code that uses <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code> should not rely on the sole existence of a
  wake up. Instead, explicit condition checking and a while loop should be used.
